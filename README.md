This file is a first past attempt at converting the new Bootstrap 4 Grid system (mixins) from SCSS to LESS.

I tend to have need to both languages for different projects so having the same functionality in both places seemed like a good idea.

The super base functionality has been roughly converted, but there's some mixins and whatnot that are just commented out for now.

Use as your own risk.

This bears the same licensing as Bootstrap itself since that's where it came from.
